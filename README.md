## Study area

California, located on the western coast of the United States, boasts an incredibly diverse and picturesque landscape. Its geography includes coastal regions, towering mountains, vast deserts, fertile valleys, and lush forests. This diversity of terrain contributes to the state's rich ecological and cultural heritage.

**Coastal Regions**: California's extensive coastline stretches for over 800 miles along the Pacific Ocean, offering stunning vistas and a temperate climate.

**Mountain Ranges**: The Sierra Nevada mountain range runs along the eastern edge of the state, with peaks exceeding 14,000 feet. The coastal ranges also contribute to the state's topographical variety.

**Deserts**: The southeastern part of California is characterized by desert landscapes, including the iconic Mojave Desert, known for its unique flora and otherworldly landscapes.

**Valleys**: Fertile valleys, such as the Central Valley, are essential agricultural regions, producing a significant portion of the nation's fruits, vegetables, and nuts.

**Forests**: California's forests, including the famous redwood and sequoia groves, are both awe-inspiring and ecologically vital.

## Problem

California's natural beauty is juxtaposed with its susceptibility to wildfires, a recurring environmental challenge that has gained considerable attention in recent years. Some of the factors attributed to this include: 

**Climate Factors**: The Mediterranean climate prevalent in much of California features hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. This creates ideal conditions for the ignition and spread of wildfires.

**Drought**: Prolonged periods of drought have left vegetation parched and susceptible to ignition. Drier conditions also lead to reduced moisture content in soil and plants.
Santa Ana Winds: These strong, dry winds originating from the desert can fan the flames of wildfires, causing rapid and unpredictable spread.

**Urban-Wildland Interface**: California's expanding urban areas often interface with wildland areas, increasing the risk of fires encroaching on populated regions.

**Human Activity**: Many wildfires are sparked by human activities, including power lines, discarded cigarettes, campfires, and equipment use. Accidental or intentional ignitions contribute to fire incidents.
